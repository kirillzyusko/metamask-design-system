# AI Agent Documentation Strategy

Documentation structure for AI coding agents (Cursor and Claude Code) working in the MetaMask Design System repository.

## Overview

Documentation has evolved for an AI-first development workflow. As most code is now created by AI agents rather than engineers manually reading comprehensive guides, our documentation strategy prioritizes:

- **AI Agent Guardrails**: Prevent common mistakes agents make repeatedly
- **Dual-Purpose Design**: Rules serve as both AI instructions and human-readable reference
- **Context Efficiency**: Checklists and examples over comprehensive tutorials
- **Markdown Format**: Structured for agents, readable for humans

Engineers can reference `.cursor/rules/` directly when needed, but the primary interaction is through agents interpreting these rules during development.

### Three-Layer Structure

```
.
├── CLAUDE.md                   # Layer 1: Entry point (40-120 lines)
├── .cursor/rules/              # Layer 2: Focused rules (200-400 lines each)
│   └── *.md                   # Individual rule files
└── docs/                       # Layer 3: High-level guides
    └── ai-agents.md           # This file - strategy explanation
```

## Layer 1: CLAUDE.md (Entry Point)

**Purpose:** Entry point loaded by Claude Code at session start.

**Content:**

- Critical invariants (never break these)
- Essential commands
- Monorepo structure overview
- Reference to cursor rules using @ file imports notation `@.cursor/rules/*.md`

**Size:** 40-120 lines (keeps context efficient)

**Philosophy:** Every line must prevent a mistake or provide essential guidance.

**Why so short?**

- Claude Code best practices recommend keeping CLAUDE.md concise
- Agents can miss key rules in verbose files
- Use explicit `@.cursor/rules/` references for detailed rules

## Layer 2: .cursor/rules/ (Focused Rules)

**Purpose:** Primary development documentation for both AI agents and humans.

**Structure:** Each rule file follows tight format:

1. **Purpose** (1-2 lines)
2. **Critical Rules** (Do/Don't bullets with ❌/✅ examples)
3. **Commands** (essential commands only)
4. **Golden Path Examples** (real file paths in codebase)
5. **Verification Steps**
6. **References** (MetaMask contributor-docs, related rules)

**Size:** 200-400 lines per file (checklists, not novels)

**Current Rule Files**

- `component-architecture.md` - Component architectural patterns (ADR-0003/0004, layered architecture, cross-platform)
- `component-creation.md` - Component scaffolding HOW-TO guide
- `component-migration.md` - Extension/mobile component migration (priority workflow)
- `component-enum-union-migration.md` - Internal ADR-0003/0004 migration
- `styling.md` - Design tokens, Tailwind, component-first
- `component-documentation.md` - Storybook and README standards
- `figma-integration.md` - Code Connect

**Planned Rule Files**

- `testing.md` - Jest, Testing Library, accessibility
- `monorepo-workflow.md` - Workspace commands

**Why this format?**

- **Context efficient:** Every line prevents a mistake
- **Actionable:** Tell agents what to do, not theory
- **Reference-based:** Rules point to canonical code examples in the codebase rather than duplicating them
- **Maintainable:** Checklists easier to update than narratives

## Layer 3: docs/ (High-Level Guides)

**Purpose:** High-level contributor guides and infrequent processes.

**Content:**

- `contributing.md` - High-level overview, points to `.cursor/rules/`
- `ai-agents.md` - This file, strategy explanation
- `reviewing-release-prs.md` - Release process
- `package-migration-process-guide.md` - Infrequent migrations

## How AI Agents Use This

### Cursor

**Automatic loading:**

- Cursor automatically loads all files in `.cursor/rules/`
- Rules guide code generation and suggestions throughout session

**Usage:**

1. Open Cursor in this repo
2. Start coding - rules apply automatically
3. All `.cursor/rules/*.md` files are loaded automatically

### Claude Code

**Session start:**

- Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically
- `CLAUDE.md` explicitly references individual rule files in `@.cursor/rules/`
- Rules persist throughout conversation

**Usage:**

1. Start new Claude Code session
2. Ask: "What are the coding conventions?" to see loaded rules
3. Reference specific rules: "What are the TypeScript patterns?"

## Key Principles

### 1. Reference Over Duplication

Rules point to existing comprehensive docs and canonical code examples rather than duplicating content. This maintains a single source of truth and stays in sync automatically.

### 2. Checklists Over Narratives

Rules use actionable Do/Don't checklists with ❌/✅ examples rather than verbose explanations or tutorials.

### 3. Context Efficiency

Every line must prevent a mistake or provide essential guidance. Remove anything agents can infer from code.

### 4. Iterative Improvement

Add rules when observing AI agents make repeated mistakes. Test with agents and refine based on their behavior.
